ðŸŽ¯ Step 1 â†’ Version Control with Git

Concept :
ðŸ‘‰ Git is Version Control System (VCS).

Git helps track changes in your code, collaborate with teams, and rollback if something breaks.


Real Life Example:

If you write 100 files in project . some bug occurred.

Use Git easily go to previous version â†’ Bug-free version will be restore.


Code Example (Git Basics â€“ Terminal Commands):

# Create a new Git repo
git init

# Add files to staging
git add file1.cpp

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Added file1.cpp"

# View history
git log

# Create new branch
git checkout -b feature-x

# Merge branch
git merge feature-x
